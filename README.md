# ANN_Surrogate_Modeling_for_Binary_VLE
This project applies Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to model binary azeotropic VLE systems in chemical engineering. It includes data preprocessing, ANN design, training, validation, and result analysis. Implemented in Python with TensorFlow/Keras, it demonstrates MLâ€™s power in thermodynamic property prediction.
